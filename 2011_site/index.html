				<a name="anton"></a>
				<p>
					Anton first got into design at university, where he studied chemical engineering. His debut work was a website for the metal band, where he played bass guitar. Anton realized that chemistry and music aren't his elements so he founded SoftFacade in late 2004. At that time he was a sole employee doing all designs and managing projects in parallel.<br>
					SoftFacade now is 25 people so Anton is less engaged in design and completely focused on the business development.
					<br><br>
					His goal is to make SoftFacade the best company in the world of interface design. In his spare time Anton loves to design new SoftFacade's website, listen to metal music and drive fast.

				<p>
					I am a commercial photographer living in Los Angeles. I was born in 1979 and grew up in San Diego. My love of photography has evolved over the years, and now seems to have branched out to the extreme sides of the spectrum. On one hand, I love doing big, epic digital composites. The possibilities are endless, as are the hours spent on it. It's an obsession, really.
					<br><br>
					On the other hand, I yearn for being outside, away from the computer, no lighting equipment, getting back to the kind of photography that got me started in the first place - shooting B/W film. Shooting with such limitations is very liberating.
					<br>
					Either way, as I move forward, I want to focus more and more on telling stories, not only with photographs, but with films as well. I love what I do!

					In 2001, he founded Neubix, a corn-fed, midwestern design agency, which became globally recognized for its simplistic, yet groundbreaking design; apparent on sites like The Big Noob: a big, blue blog about nothing.
					<br>
					Circa 2005, Brad took a hiatus from client work and moved his company to Boston, joining forces with the team at PureVolume.
					<br>
					Now hailing from the island of Manhattan, Brad and his team have charted a course into the land of easy-to-use, elegant website builders.

					But that wasn't his destiny. After four years he left the university to start another career - fighting with bears for food. 
					<br>
					Dmitry was a successful freelance designer, playing Nintendo all days long, when he met Anton Zykin several years later. Anton suggested him to move to St. Petersburg and work for SoftFacade.<br>
					Now he is a head of design department and still plays Nintendo every day and sometimes crafts icons with his own secret tricks and combos. Dmitry likes mojito, video games and vector graphics.

					Chris is a photographer, musician, and burrito connoisseur, but that's probably less relevant to you than his interest in computers in general and Linux in particular. He's spoken at many events such as FOWA, Wordcamp, and SXSWi largely because he actually knows things like what all that mess in the /proc filesystem is there for, and gets really excited about stuff like fast asynchronous polling in the kernel. Chris works for (mt) Media Temple, where he splits time between performance R&D, a variety of biz dev projects, and systems architecture for Virb.

The Double Conference Pass is meant for 2 people attending Valio Con together and who want to share one room. This pass includes just 1 room for both nights, but gives you 2 Conference Passes.</p>
